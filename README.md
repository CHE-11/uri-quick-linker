# URI Quick Linker
URI Quick Linker is a fast way to copy and paste URI links in your project. This makes it easy to make a way to link to a specific page in your project from a different page.


## Usage
The extension gives you two options on the right click context menu: 
- Copy URI and Line Number
- Paste Commented URI
- Format Commented URI's
  - Sometimes the extension glitches and doesn't turn the URI into a link. This option will format the URI into a link.


## Development
To work on the extension, simple copy the repo, and run ```yarn install``` to install the dependencies. Then run the VS Code command ```Start Debugging``` to start the extension in a new window.

## Acknowlegements

My extension is heavily based off [Elliot Betancourt's Extension - hipdot-vs-code-url-scheme-grabber](https://github.com/ebetancourt/hipdot-vs-code-url-scheme-grabber/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) which is heavily based off the hardwork of Nisanth Chunduru:[nisanthchunduru/vscode-copy-filepath-with-line-number](https://github.com/nisanthchunduru/vscode-copy-filepath-with-line-number): VSCode extension to copy current file's full path with current line number.

Big thanks to both!
